# Channel Points TTS with Reward Queue Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation transitions the Channel Points TTS feature from a chat-message-based trigger to a proper Twitch EventSub-based system. This allows streamers to control whether TTS messages play immediately or only after manual approval in their Twitch reward queue.

## Implementation Date

October 25, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes (chatvibes-web-ui)

#### File: `public/dashboard.html`
- **Line 251**: Updated label text from "Auto-approve (skip queue)" to "Skip the Reward Queue"
  - This makes the functionality clearer and aligns with Twitch's terminology
  - When checked: TTS plays immediately (reward skips the queue)
  - When unchecked: TTS only plays after manual approval in Twitch's Reward Requests queue

### 2. Backend Changes (tts-twitch)

#### New File: `src/components/twitch/redemptionCache.js`
A new in-memory cache module for tracking pending Channel Points redemptions.

**Key Features:**
- Stores redemptions waiting for approval: `{ userInput, userName, timestamp, channelName }`
- 24-hour TTL (Time To Live) for cache entries
- Automatic pruning every 6 hours to prevent memory leaks
- Functions:
  - `addRedemption()` - Add a pending redemption to cache
  - `getRedemption()` - Retrieve a cached redemption by ID
  - `removeRedemption()` - Remove from cache after processing or cancellation
  - `pruneOldEntries()` - Clean up stale entries
  - `getCacheSize()` - Get current cache size
  - `clearCache()` - Manual cache clear (for testing)

#### File: `src/components/twitch/twitchSubs.js`
Added two new EventSub subscription functions:

1. **`subscribeChannelPointsRedemptionAdd(broadcasterUserId)`**
   - Subscribes to `channel.channel_points_custom_reward_redemption.add`
   - Receives events when a reward is redeemed (both fulfilled and unfulfilled)

2. **`subscribeChannelPointsRedemptionUpdate(broadcasterUserId)`**
   - Subscribes to `channel.channel_points_custom_reward_redemption.update`
   - Receives events when redemption status changes (approved, canceled, etc.)

3. **Updated `subscribeChannelToTtsEvents()`**
   - Added `channelPointsAdd` and `channelPointsUpdate` options (both enabled by default)
   - These subscriptions are now automatically created for all managed channels

**Permissions Required:**
- Both subscriptions require the `channel:read:redemptions` scope (already requested by the bot)

#### File: `src/components/twitch/eventsub.js`
Major enhancements to handle the new Channel Points redemption events.

**New Imports:**
- `redemptionCache` - For tracking pending redemptions
- `publishTtsEvent` - For Pub/Sub distribution
- `processMessageUrls` - For URL processing

**New Functions:**

1. **`handleChannelPointsRedemption(subscriptionType, event)`**
   - Main handler for Channel Points redemption events
   - Validates the reward ID matches the configured TTS reward
   - Checks if Channel Points TTS is enabled
   - Handles both `redemption.add` and `redemption.update` events

2. **`processTtsRedemption(channelLogin, userInput, userName, ttsConfig)`**
   - Processes a TTS redemption with content policy enforcement
   - Validates message length, blocked links, and banned words
   - Processes URLs based on channel configuration
   - Publishes to Pub/Sub for distribution to all bot instances

3. **`getBroadcasterIdByLogin(channelLogin)`**
   - Helper function with caching to avoid repeated API lookups

4. **`getSharedSessionInfo(channelLogin)`**
   - Gets shared chat session info for cross-channel TTS

**Event Flow:**

**Scenario A: "Skip the Reward Queue" is CHECKED (auto-approve enabled)**
1. User redeems the reward
2. EventSub sends `redemption.add` event with `status: "fulfilled"`
3. Bot immediately processes and plays TTS

**Scenario B: "Skip the Reward Queue" is UNCHECKED (manual approval required)**
1. User redeems the reward
2. EventSub sends `redemption.add` event with `status: "unfulfilled"`
3. Bot adds redemption to cache
4. Streamer approves in Twitch dashboard
5. EventSub sends `redemption.update` event with `status: "fulfilled"`
6. Bot retrieves from cache, processes, and plays TTS
7. Bot removes entry from cache

**Scenario C: Redemption is canceled**
1. EventSub sends `redemption.update` event with `status: "canceled"`
2. Bot removes entry from cache (no TTS played)

#### File: `src/bot.js`
Removed the old chat-based Channel Points redemption handler.

**Changes:**
- Removed the entire `if (tags['custom-reward-id'])` block (lines 358-395 in the old version)
- Replaced with a simple check that logs and ignores any custom reward messages
- Added clear documentation that Channel Points redemptions are now handled exclusively via EventSub

**Rationale:**
- Prevents duplicate TTS playback
- EventSub provides better reliability and proper queue integration
- Chat messages don't contain information about redemption approval status

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Proper Queue Integration**: Streamers can now use Twitch's native reward queue for moderation
2. **No Duplicate Messages**: EventSub-only approach eliminates race conditions
3. **Better Moderation**: Streamers can review redemptions before they play
4. **Consistent with Twitch UX**: Follows standard Twitch reward behavior
5. **Reliable**: EventSub webhooks are more reliable than chat message parsing
6. **Status Tracking**: Full visibility into redemption lifecycle (unfulfilled â†’ fulfilled/canceled)

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
1. Test `redemptionCache.js` functions (add, get, remove, prune)
2. Test `handleChannelPointsRedemption()` with various event scenarios
3. Test content policy enforcement in `processTtsRedemption()`

### Integration Tests
1. Create a reward with "Skip Queue" checked - verify immediate playback
2. Create a reward with "Skip Queue" unchecked - verify playback only after approval
3. Test redemption cancellation - verify no TTS plays and cache is cleared
4. Test ignored users - verify their redemptions don't trigger TTS
5. Test content policy violations (too short, too long, banned words, links)

### Production Testing
1. Monitor EventSub webhook logs for proper event reception
2. Verify redemption cache size remains bounded (pruning works)
3. Test with multiple concurrent redemptions
4. Verify shared chat sessions work correctly

## Configuration Notes

### For Streamers

When creating a Channel Points TTS reward in the dashboard:
- **"Skip the Reward Queue" CHECKED**: TTS plays immediately (auto-approve)
- **"Skip the Reward Queue" UNCHECKED**: TTS plays only after you approve in your Twitch dashboard

### For Developers

The bot automatically subscribes to these EventSub events for all managed channels:
- `channel.channel_points_custom_reward_redemption.add`
- `channel.channel_points_custom_reward_redemption.update`

Make sure the bot has the `channel:read:redemptions` scope in its OAuth configuration.

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
None. The implementation is backward compatible:
- Existing reward IDs are preserved
- Content policies continue to work
- All existing configuration is respected

### Deployment Steps
1. Deploy the updated code to the bot backend
2. The bot will automatically subscribe to the new EventSub events on next channel sync
3. No manual intervention required for existing channels
4. Frontend changes are cosmetic (label text only)

## Troubleshooting

### TTS Not Playing After Approval
1. Check EventSub webhook logs - are `redemption.update` events being received?
2. Verify the reward ID in Firestore matches the reward in Twitch
3. Check that Channel Points TTS is enabled in the dashboard
4. Verify the user is not on the ignore list

### Redemptions Stuck in Cache
1. Check cache size with `redemptionCache.getCacheSize()`
2. Manual cleanup: `redemptionCache.clearCache()`
3. Verify automatic pruning is working (every 6 hours)

### Duplicate TTS Playback
1. Ensure the old code is fully removed from `bot.js`
2. Check that no custom reward messages are being processed in the IRC handler
3. Verify only EventSub events trigger TTS

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. Persistent cache (Firestore) for redemptions across bot restarts
2. Analytics dashboard for redemption approval rates
3. Streamer notification when redemption is pending
4. Batch approval/rejection via custom dashboard UI
5. Cooldown enforcement at the EventSub level
